## Dashboard Features
### 1. **Top Defect Types for Kia and Hyundai**
   - Visualizes the most frequent defect types by manufacturer.
   - **Insight**: Highlights engine and electrical system defects as critical areas.

### 2. **Impact of Mileage on Defect Severity**
   - Analyzes the relationship between mileage and severity score.
   - **Insight**: High-severity complaints are more prevalent at lower mileage ranges.

### 3. **Proportion of High-Severity Defects**
   - Displays the distribution of high-severity defects by defect type.
   - **Insight**: Engine defects dominate high-severity claims.

### 4. **Defect Severity Trends Over Time**
   - Tracks defect severity trends from 2020 to 2024.
   - **Insight**: Severity scores are consistent over time, suggesting systemic issues.

### 5. **Regional Defect Patterns**
   - Provides a regional breakdown of defect claims using a tree map.
   - **Insight**: California, Texas, and Florida report the highest claim volumes.

### 6. **Repair Duration Distribution by Defect Type**
   - Compares repair durations for different defect types.
   - **Insight**: Certain defect types, such as parking brakes, have prolonged repair times.
